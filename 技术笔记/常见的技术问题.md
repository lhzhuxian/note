**Disadvantages of recursion**

1. Recursive functions are generally slower than non-recursive function.

2. It may require a lot of memory space to hold intermediate results on the system stacks.

3. It is not more efficient in terms of space and time complexity.

4. The computer may run out of memory if the recursive calls are not properly checked.
