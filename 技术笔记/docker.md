### What is a container

Containers are similar to VMs, but they have relaxed isolation properties to **share the Operating System (OS)** among the applications. Therefore, containers are considered lightweight. Similar to a VM, a container has its **own filesystem, share of CPU, memory, process space, and more**. As they are decoupled from the underlying infrastructure, they are portable across clouds and OS distributions.

## What is a container image?

When running a container, it uses an isolated filesystem. This custom filesystem is provided by a **container image**. Since the image contains the container’s filesystem, it must contain everything needed to run an application - all dependencies, configuration, scripts, binaries, etc. The image also contains other configuration for the container, such as environment variables, a default command to run, and other metadata.



### What is Docker

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

**Fast, consistent delivery of your applications**

Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services. Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows.

Consider the following example scenario:

- Your developers write code locally and share their work with their colleagues using Docker containers.
- They use Docker to push their applications into a test environment and execute automated and manual tests.
- When developers find bugs, they can fix them in the development environment and redeploy them to the test environment for testing and validation.
- When testing is complete, getting the fix to the customer is as simple as pushing the updated image to the production environment.

**Responsive deployment and scaling**

Docker’s container-based platform allows for highly portable workloads. Docker containers can run on a developer’s local laptop, on physical or virtual machines in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments.

Docker’s portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to dynamically manage workloads, scaling up or tearing down applications and services as business needs dictate, in near real time.

**Running more workloads on the same hardware**

Docker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective alternative to hypervisor-based virtual machines, so you can use more of your compute capacity to achieve your business goals. Docker is perfect for high density environments and for small and medium deployments where you need to do more with fewer resources.

## Docker architecture

Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker *client* talks to the Docker *daemon*, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon *can* run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface. Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.
