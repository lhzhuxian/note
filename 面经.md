1.) Implement grep command : grep "String" --context=5
2.) Behavioral
3.) 2D array with numbers(coins), can only choose one number from each row (has to choose, cannot skip)
Keep moving until to the last row of the grid to collect coins. But if you choose x-th column from previous row with
a differnt y-th column from the current row, there's a cost of changing fee: Abs(x - y)
What's the maximun final coins you could collect after paying changing fees(if applicable)

4.) 2D array with walls and empty cells. Find the LONGEST way out from first row to the bottom row.
Each cell can only be visited once, can only go left, right and down direction.
Can start at any cell from the top row as well as can exit from any cell in the bottom row, can only start and exit from empty cell.

5.) Given a dictionary full of valid words and give a input String.
Determine if the input String is "shrinkable"
Shrinkable means that you can take out any character(one at a time), and everytime you take a character, the new string has to be a valid word that is in the dictionary until you end up with a single letter.
