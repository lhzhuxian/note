\1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero

## 191 Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Note:**

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3**, the input represents the signed integer. `-3`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
```

 **Solution**

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
   public int hammingWeight(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (n != 0) {
        sum++;
        n &= (n - 1);
    }
    return sum;
}

}
```



## int 转换成二进制字符串

**Solution**

```java
public static String BitIntToBinary(int n) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for(int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {
            sb.append((n & 1) == 0 ? "0" : " 1");
            n = n >> 1;
        }
        return sb.reverse().toString();
    }

// 只对正数work
public static String intToBinary(int n) {
  StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
  while(n > 0) {
    sb.append(n % 2 == 0 ? "0" : " 1");
    n = n / 2;
  }
  return sb.reverse().toString();
   }
```



## 393 UTF-8 Validation

Given an integer array `data` representing the data, return whether it is a valid **UTF-8** encoding.

A character in **UTF8** can be from **1 to 4 bytes** long, subjected to the following rules:

1. For a **1-byte** character, the first bit is a `0`, followed by its Unicode code.
2. For an **n-bytes** character, the first `n` bits are all one's, the `n + 1` bit is `0`, followed by `n - 1` bytes with the most significant `2` bits being `10`.

This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:

```
   Char. number range  |        UTF-8 octet sequence
      (hexadecimal)    |              (binary)
   --------------------+---------------------------------------------
   0000 0000-0000 007F | 0xxxxxxx
   0000 0080-0000 07FF | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0000 0800-0000 FFFF | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0001 0000-0010 FFFF | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
```

**Note:** The input is an array of integers. Only the **least significant 8 bits** of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.

 **Example 1:**

```
Input: data = [197,130,1]
Output: true
Explanation: data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: data = [235,140,4]
Output: false
Explanation: data represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.
```

**Solution**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validUtf8(int[] data) {

        // Number of bytes in the current UTF-8 character
        int numberOfBytesToProcess = 0;

        // Masks to check two most significant bits in a byte.
        int mask1 = 1 << 7;
        int mask2 = 1 << 6;

        // For each integer in the data array.
        for(int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            // If this is the case then we are to start processing a new UTF-8 character.
          // 这是常见用来查看bit是否mask的手段 重点！！！！
            if (numberOfBytesToProcess == 0) {
                int mask = 1 << 7;
                 while ((mask & data[i]) != 0) {
                    numberOfBytesToProcess += 1;
                    mask = mask >> 1;
                 }

                // 1 byte characters
                if (numberOfBytesToProcess == 0) {
                    continue;
                }

                // Invalid scenarios according to the rules of the problem.
                if (numberOfBytesToProcess > 4 || numberOfBytesToProcess == 1) {
                    return false;
                }

            } else {

                // data[i] should have most significant bit set and
                // second most significant bit unset. So, we use the two masks
                // to make sure this is the case.
                if (!((data[i] & mask1) != 0 && (mask2 & data[i]) == 0)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }

            // We reduce the number of bytes to process by 1 after each integer.
            numberOfBytesToProcess -= 1;
        }

        // This is for the case where we might not have the complete data for
        // a particular UTF-8 character.
        return numberOfBytesToProcess == 0;
    }
}
```
