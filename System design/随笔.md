We cannot run the machines with full capacity. E.g if a machine can support upto 50K connections then we should still bring up more machines to not go above 70% - 80% if the load per machine. Load balancer should drop connection requests if there is a large burst of requests(rate limiting) and then the clients should do exponential backoff before resending the connect request
