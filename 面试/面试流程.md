面试流程



自我介绍

My name is Hui Li. I graduated from Duke University in  may 2019 with a master in computer engineering. After I joined Walmart until now.  Our team is mexico search team. The main responisbility of our team  is to provide backend support for search in mexico market. For me , I am focusing more on  improve relevancy and reanking of the search results, Including pre retrieval query processing like query understanding, retrieval strategies(teawking the query to our search engine), rerank and personalization of search results. 

We are using Java and Python to build microservices with framework like spring boot ,fastApi. I have the experiences to launch the product on my own from problem understanding to shipping the solution. I am currently working closely with  newly joined data scientist to build the data pipleline and ship the machine learning solutions.



Why tick tock? 

Love the product.  It would be great that I can contribute to the product that I love and used everyday, And I have several friends work there. They told me it is a aweesome place to work in. Their teammates are talent and working there is chanllging, and always new things to learn. Always like Day 1







What is the currently remote work policy in facebook? Do you know how it will change after the pandemic?

How is work life balance in Facebook?

 What kind of team culture do you have? Is there a team happy hour ?

How many people are currently in your team? Whatis the distribution between senior and junior engineers?

What is the new-hire onboarding process?

How and when are the performance reviews conducted?

What is your favorite part about working here?

What are the current projects that you are working on ?

What gets you most excited about the company's future?





Let me share you a quick story. At that time, I way driving the project to build rerank service. The goal of this service is to rerank the results after we retrieve it from Solr. We want our result is driven by user signal data, like user click, add to cart instead of pure text relevancy. 

At first, we planned  to ship a machine learning solution. Since we don't have a data scientist in our team, I corporate with a data scientist from data team. However, our company was facing a big reorg at that time and due to a lot of reasons. That data scientist cannot work for our team. My manager told me that we may need to halt this project for now untill we find another data scientist to continue with the model training.  However, that will definatly missed our deadline and  we may also have the chance to miss the hot sales which is the most imnportant event in mexico market. that is not acceptable. This is an important feature that will improve the costumer's search quality. 

 In order to launch this service before hot sales to meet the needs of customers, I did some research on my own and redeisgned the rerank service  to use a more traditional and heruistic way to handle this problem. I mixed up together all the factors like text relevancy score, user signal data, sales data, fresshness to generate a final score and use it to rank the documents. Then I also booked some time of our former data scientist to review this new solution using his expertise.  Later, I have a meeting with my manager  and convince him to launch this approach first then later we can migrate to a machine laerning solution. I succesfully launched this new service before the hot sales and it actually generate a pretty good result. One important thing I learned is that there are a lot of solutions to a problem and sometimes a simple solution can also make a big impact.





项目

叙述故事的时候最好用STAR模式，一定要挑你有high impact的说，就算重复也没关系，不然会被说impact不够。描述的方式也很重要，**就算实际上很简单也要说的给人一种很复杂的感觉**。。。 网上可以找到很多具体问题，举几个常见的例子：
          o Most challenge/proud project
          o Failures
          o Miss deadline
          o Conflict with manager/colleague
          o Negative feedback



当面试官对你做的项目刨根问底问细节时，如果没做过或确实不懂可以礼貌的说**That’s a good point，但一些现实原因，如budget有限，时间有限等，我们未能在这方面深入**，这样来结束现在的话题



控制时间很重要，比如phone的话就不需要说得太具体，不然coding时间会不够，而专门的behavior或者deep dive轮就可以说得很详细。而且要根据具体情况决定要不要说很多technical的细节。

做题

1. Over Communication
在视频上， 面试官和面试者能看到的对方的range很有限，有的时候你的body language可能没有被对方看到，或者我看到地里有一些很可惜的栗子，自己只是看了另外一个屏幕码代码，却被误以为作弊。废话不多说，给几个我经常在VO中说的吧：
" Hey, if I look like I am looking to my right/left, that's because my camera is here and I have my codepad opened on another screen"
" Hi, if I am silent for a couple secs/mins, I am just thinking through the question"
这个时候十有八九面试官会跟你说， 没关系， 你想到什么就说就好了, 那这个时候你就要开始分析了：这个题是要我干什么=》 我有什么已知条件=》 我觉得大概的思路是什么，或者你没思路，我觉得需要什么data structure会帮助到我=》 你觉得我说的对吗。

1. 和面试官交流确定题目的限制条件 

有什么限制条件吗？ 二叉树的value是什么类型？ 这个api谁来使用， 内部的还是public的？ 这个api更注重speed还是space?  我需要多线程吗？ 如果面试者没问任何问题马上开始照着leetcode的signature开始coding, 甚至**class 名字也叫solution(很多人）** 

甚至确认sample input/output。然后问一些edge cases，这样一来表明你的确有考虑这些问题

2. 思考一会儿题目方案

要解释time complexity

should I start implement it in code, or you want me to conitnue to optimize it?

3. 写完code一定要跑test cases

不是盯着你的code自己看，要说出来。你刚开始问的那些edge cases就是一个提醒。

字迹不要太潦草。你不赶时间，除非你思如泉涌怕自己忘了。一些null checking的无聊但是必须的语句，在征得面试官同意的情况可以只写一个comment： // check null etc... (May I skip these checks to save time?). 但是这个comment一定要写，否则面试官可能写报告的时候会忘记。

在每个必要的地方都会写注释， 然后有些思路， 我会先在注释里walk through思路，方便面试官理解，也方便我自己实现。



follow up question

如果关心work life balance (no, not everyone cares about it... 公司也有权利选出最适合公司文化的candidate吧。。。见Andrew Ng的说法)
可以问what's a typical day like
可以问大家一般几点来几点走，sprint如何run是daily standup还是什么之类



1. 对自己的简历非常不熟悉， 技术，项目
2. 常见的基础知识，nosql vs sql， multi thread
3. 做题太粗心了， loop一定要检查是不是update counter 了， 别写出inifinite loop
4.
