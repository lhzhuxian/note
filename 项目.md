## Search Engine Re-plaform

### Objective

To outline our high-level approach for switching enterprise-search solutions from Oracle Endeca to SolrCloud. Herein, we articulate a stepwise plan to execute this re-platforming. 

### Project Goal

Among our re-platforming goals are moving to a cloud native(1) and scalable(2) search engine with a thriving developer community(3) and continued cutting-edge development(4). We aim to deprecate legacy techologies, like Oracle Endeca and one-day Oracle ATG, to improve performance and relevance as our catalog and query diversity continue to expand. Our current Oracle Endeca implementation will max-out at <1M catalog SKUs. Our goal is to scale easily to 30+M on SolrCloud.

- To prepare for Buen Fin, SolrCloud will be in production to 100% of users on EA by November 14th. 
- From the end-user and business user standpoint, this activity should result in near 100% functional parity with the current search engine, with clear callouts of any differences, new or discontinued functionalities.
- Before launch, non-functional activities like performance and load test are mandatory to be executed
- Before launch, relevance testing, analysis, and algorithm iteration are mandatory
- The audience ramp will be gradual, using an A/B test to go from 1% to 50% audience. After 50% of traffic is going to each search system with satisfactory results, we can remove the A/B test and proceed to 100% audience.



SolrCloud MVP Platform Development

- Create basic SolrCloud infrastructure in the public cloud 
- New indexing service [full/partial indexing]
- Search query service
- Endeca MDEX search replaced by the new solr cloud to serve search and browse results

Shadowing, Testing and validation

- Shadow Endeca's live traffic in SolrCloud, logging details on production traffic and queries
- Performance and load tests
- A/B tests
- Relevance Validation of new Solr Search Service to be at least on parity with current search service.
