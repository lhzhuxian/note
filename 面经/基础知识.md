### process vs thread

A process is **an instance of a computer program** containing binary code along with the following resources .

- Memory: storage for current program CPU is handling(located outside CPU)
- [Registers](http://pediaa.com/difference-between-register-and-main-memory/): short-term storage of the data and transfer them from one component to another
- [Stack](http://pediaa.com/difference-between-stack-and-queue/): linear LIFO data structure, containing temporary information. e.g. Local variables, return addresses, etc.
- [Counter](http://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-stack-pointer-and-program-counter/): a register indicating the next instruction
- Heap: allocating memory to a process at run time

And a thread is a component of a process. It is an **execution unit** and it contains program counter, stack and set of registers. 

The main difference between them is whether they share memory or not. Each process does not share them, thus operating independently. Threads, on the other hand, share the same memory allocated to that process.

**Thread safety** As mentioned, multi-threading shares memory, which may cause unexpected outputs. So you have to make sure those malfunctions will not occur, this concept is called as thread safety. For example, you need to use thread-safe datatype in the multi-thread process(`Queue` class for Ruby).



### Concurrency vs parallelism

There are similar concepts named *concurrency* and *parallelism*.

- Parallelism: two tasks literally run at the same time
- Concurrency: two tasks can be ‘in progress’ at the same time

Concurrency is a little tricky, but the main difference is that in concurrency there is always only one task that is actually running.

transaction， db 的 transcation 是怎么支持的



mutex 和semaphore的区别，



virtual memory & page,  difference between C++ template and virtual function.



### java final finally finalized

The **final** keyword can be used with **class method and variable**.  A final class cannot be **extended**, a final method cannot be **overridden** and a final variable cannot be **reassgined**.

The **finally** keyword is used to create a block of code that follows a try block. **A finally block of code always excutes whether or not an exception has occurred**. Using a finally block allows you to run any cleanup-type statements that you just wish to execute.







又问了十分钟进程和线程，有什么区别，怎么通信



问了工作中的technical challenge和如何解决。然后问问题，问了process vs thread，write-thru cache vs write-back cache，java如何handle exception。

multithread vs multiprocess
stack memory, heap
C++, Java memory allocation 發生在compile or runtime

virtual memory有关的知识

Java finally final finalize, mutex vs semaphore 还有 binary semaphore
